# Postgraduate-Management-System
This project is a dummy postgraduate managment system for the German University in Cairo whhere we keep track of students pursuing there postgraduate studies, their thesis, their supervisors and examiners.
The database of this system in implemented using SQL while the web application is implemented using ASP.net with C#.
This project is implemented in cooperation with three of my GUCian colleagues:
Aly Hassan Elsokkary
Aya Ahmed Abdelrahman Fayed
Abdelrahman Fathy Elsalh
Note that the web application does not allow us to preform all the stored SQL procedures as this project was done for educational purpose
